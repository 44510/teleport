## Can I provide a custom DNS name for Teleport generated CA?

Yes, use `server_name` under the `tls` section in your Teleport configuration
file. Please look on our reference
[configuration file](./reference/configuration.mdx#database-service-configuration)
for more details.

## Can I disable CA verification when connecting to a database?

Yes, although it is not recommended. Certificate verification prevents
person-in-the-middle attacks and makes sure that you
are connected to the database that you intended to. 

Teleport also allows you to edit your
[configuration file](./reference/configuration.mdx#database-service-configuration)
to provide a custom CA certificate (`ca_cert_file`) or custom DNS name
(`server_name`), which is more secure. 

If none of the above options work for you and you still want to disable the CA
check, you can use `mode` under the `tls` option in the Teleport configuration file.

For more details please refer to the reference
[configuration file](./reference/configuration.mdx#database-service-configuration).
