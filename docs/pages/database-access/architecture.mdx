### Proxy Service to the Database Service

{/* TODO: Find a better place for this info*/}

The connection between the Proxy Service and the Database Service is also
authenticated with mutual TLS.

The Proxy Service generates a short-lived X.509 certificate signed by the
cluster's host authority, with the client's identity and database routing
information encoded in it, and uses it to authenticate with the Database Service.
