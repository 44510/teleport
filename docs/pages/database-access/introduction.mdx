Teleport can provide secure connections to your databases while improving both
access control and visibility.

Some of the things you can do with database access:

- Enable users to retrieve short-lived database certificates using a Single Sign-On
  flow, thus maintaining their organization-wide identity.
- Configure role-based access controls for databases and implement custom
  [Access Request](../access-controls/access-requests.mdx) workflows.
- Capture database activity in the Teleport audit log.

## Architecture

![Teleport Database Access Diagram](../../img/database-access/architecture.svg)

The Teleport Database Service performs database authentication and protocol
parsing. Because the Database Service establishes an SSH reverse tunnel to the
Proxy Service, users do not need to have direct connectivity to the Database
Service or the databases it's connected to. As long as it can dial back to the
cluster's Proxy Service, it can be located behind a firewall.

Database Service can be also connected to multiple databases.

The `tsh` client tool, Teleport Database Service, and Teleport Proxy Service
work together to enable secure access to databases

1. A user logs into the cluster with `tsh login` command and retrieves
   a short-lived X.509 client certificate. See [Issuing User Certificates](../architecture/authentication.mdx)
   for more details on how it works.
1. The user picks the database they want to connect to from the list of available
   databases shown in `tsh db ls` command.
1. The user connects to the database with the `tsh db connect` command, which
   first retrieves a short-lived X.509 certificate and then launches the
   standard database client (e.g. `psql`) with this client certificate to
   authenticate with the Teleport Proxy Service.
1. The Proxy Service authenticates the connection and dispatches it to the
   appropriate Database Service instance based on the routing information
   encoded in the client certificate, over the reverse tunnel.
1. The Database Service authenticates the connection, performs an authorization
   check, and then establishes the connection to the database.
1. The Database Service begins proxying traffic between the user's database
   client and the database. Additionally, it interprets the database wire
   protocol messages and submits events to the Teleport audit log.

To learn more about configuring role-based access control for database access,
check out the [RBAC](./rbac.mdx) section.

Learn how to configure [automatic user
provisioning](./auto-user-provisioning.mdx), which removes the need for creating
individual user accounts in advance or using the same set of shared database
accounts for all users.

The [Architecture](./architecture.mdx) section provides a more in-depth look at
Teleport Database Service internals such as networking and security.

See [Reference](./reference.mdx) for an overview of
database access-related configuration and CLI commands.
