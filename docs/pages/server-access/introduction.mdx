Teleport enables you to consolidate SSH access across your infrastructure, reduce configuration
complexity, and implement best practices for security and compliance with full visibility of
session activity and audit log events.

The most common reasons to use Teleport to protect access to SSH servers include the following scenarios:

- You manage a large number of resources clusters from the command-line or programmatically and you want 
  to simplify the stack you use to manage security and configuration requirements across the infrastructure.
- You must track and audit user sessions to regulatory or compliance guidelines. 
- You have users who require a complete, dedicated, and secure SSH option in addition to the certificate authority 
  provided by the Teleport Auth Service and proxy provided by the Teleport Proxy Service.
- You want to maximize resource and network security by using SSH certificates with two-factor authentication, 
  single sign-on (SSO), and short-lived certificates.

The topics in this guide describe how to configure Teleport to provide secure access to 
SSH servers and SSH-related services.

The following diagram provides a simplified view of the architecture for managing
access to SSH server through Teleport:

## Start with the most common scenarios

You can configure Teleport SSH Service to control different aspects of access for 
different scenarios. For example, you can configure Teleport SSH Service to provide
agentless operation and to work with Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) to 
manage privileges.

- [Get started](./getting-started.mdx) demonstrates how to configure Teleport to protect access to SSH for the most common SSH use-cases.
- [Using Teleport with PAM](./ssh-pam.mdx) describes how to configure Teleport SSH with PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules).
- [Agentless OpenSSH Integration](./openssh.mdx) describes how to use Teleport in agentless mode on systems with OpenSSH and `sshd`.
- [Host User Creation](./host-user-creation.mdx): How to configure Teleport to automatically create transient host users.
- [Linux Auditing System](./auditd.mdx): How to integrate Teleport with the Linux Auditing System (auditd).

## Record session activity

The following topics provide information about configuring Teleport SSH Service to record session activity:

- [Recording Proxy Mode](./recording-proxy-mode.mdx): How to use Teleport Recording Proxy Mode to capture activity on OpenSSH servers.
- [BPF Session Recording](./bpf-session-recording.mdx): How to use BPF to record SSH session commands, modified files and network connections.
- [Restricted Sessions](./restricted-session.mdx): How to configure and use Restricted Session to apply security policies to SSH sessions.

## Work with integrated development environments
