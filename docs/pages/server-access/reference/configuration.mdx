`teleport.yaml` fields related to server access:

```yaml
# Main service responsible for server access.
#
(!docs/pages/includes/config-reference/ssh-service.yaml!)
```

## Deployment

The Server Service can be deployed in two modes.

### Direct mode

<Admonition type="note">
Direct mode is only available for self-hosted Teleport clusters.
</Admonition>

In *direct* mode, Server Services registers directly with the Teleport
Auth Server, and listens for ssh connections from the Teleport Proxy. To
enable direct mode, set `ssh_service.listen_addr` in
`teleport.yaml`, and ensure that `teleport.auth_server` points directly at the
Auth Server. Direct mode requires network connectivity from the Teleport Proxy
to Server Service, and from Server Service to the Auth Server.

### IoT mode (reverse tunnel)

In *IoT mode*, Server Service only needs to be able to make an outbound
connection to a Teleport Proxy. The Server Service establishes a
reverse tunnel to the proxy, and both registration with the Auth Server and
ssh sessions are performed over this tunnel. To enable this mode, ensure
that `ssh_service.listen_addr` is *unset*, and point
`teleport.proxy_server` at a Teleport Proxy.
