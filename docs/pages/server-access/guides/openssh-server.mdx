In this guide, we will show you how to configure the OpenSSH server `sshd` to
join a Teleport cluster. Existing fleets of OpenSSH servers can be configured to
accept SSH certificates dynamically issued by a Teleport CA.

Using Teleport and OpenSSH has the advantage of getting you up
and running, but in the long run, we would recommend replacing `sshd` with `teleport`.
We've outlined these reasons in [OpenSSH vs Teleport SSH for Servers?](https://gravitational.com/blog/openssh-vs-teleport/)

## Prerequisites

- A Linux host with the OpenSSH server `sshd` installed, but not Teleport.

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

(!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)

## Step 1/3. Configure `sshd` to trust the Teleport CA

`sshd` must be told to allow users to log in with certificates generated by the
Teleport Auth Service. Start by exporting the Teleport CA public key.

<ScopedBlock scope="cloud">On your local machine,</ScopedBlock>
<ScopedBlock scope={["oss", "enterprise"]}>On your Auth Service host,</ScopedBlock>
print the Teleport certificate authority certificate to stdout:

```code
$ tctl auth export --type=user | sed "s/cert-authority\ //"
```

Copy the output. On the host where you are running `sshd`, run the following commands.

Assign the output of the `tctl auth export` command to an environment variable:

```code
$ export KEY="<pasted output>"
```

Make the public key accessible to `sshd`:

```code
$ sudo bash -c "echo \"$KEY\" > /etc/ssh/teleport_user_ca.pub"
$ sudo bash -c "echo 'TrustedUserCAKeys /etc/ssh/teleport_user_ca.pub' >> /etc/ssh/sshd_config"
```

Restart `sshd`. For systemd-enabled hosts, run the following command:

```code
$ sudo systemctl restart sshd
```

Now, `sshd` will trust users who present a Teleport-issued certificate.

## Step 2/3. Configure host authentication

Next, ask Teleport to issue valid host certificates for your `sshd` host. 

<ScopedBlock scope="cloud">

### Ensure that your user has the correct privileges

Your user must be authorized to read and write host certificates.

Create a file called `host-certifier.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v5
metadata:
  name: host-certifier
spec:
  allow:
    rules:
      - resources:
          - host_cert
        verbs:
          - list
          - create
          - read
          - update
          - delete
```

Create the role resource:

```code
$ tctl create host-certifier.yaml
# role 'host-certifier' has been created
```

Fetch the configuration for your user. Replace `USERNAME` with the name of the
Teleport username that you used to log in to your cluster.

```code
$ tctl get user/USERNAME > myuser.yaml
```

Make the following change to `myuser.yaml`:

```diff
  roles:
   - access
   - auditor
   - editor
+  - host-certifier
```

Apply your change:

```code
$ tctl create -f myuser.yaml
```

Log out of your Teleport cluster and log in again.

You will now have the required permissions to export a host key for your `sshd`
host.


### Issue a host certificate

</ScopedBlock>

On <ScopedBlock scope="cloud">your local machine</ScopedBlock><ScopedBlock scope={["oss", "enterprise"]}>your Auth Service host</ScopedBlock>, assign the
IP address or fully qualified domain name of your Node to an environment
variable.

```code
$ ADDR=203.0.113.0
```

Run the following `tctl` command to generate a host certificate:

```code
$ tctl auth sign \
      --host=${ADDR?} \
      --format=openssh \
      --out=myhost

# The credentials have been written to myhost, myhost-cert.pub
```

The above command will result in a private key and certificate.

To generate certificates for multiple hosts, assign the `host` flag to a
comma-separated list of addresses. Certificates for wildcard domains are not
supported by OpenSSH, so each domain must be fully qualified.

Use `ssh-keygen` to verify the contents of the certificate:

```code
$ ssh-keygen -L -f myhost-cert.pub
```

The `Principals` section should contain the address you assigned to `ADDR`
earlier:

```
myhost-cert.pub:
        Type: ssh-rsa-cert-v01@openssh.com host certificate
        Public key: RSA-CERT SHA256:nHkp6SnrAW4AV00VUaqPgR6SgdyvV9MmjUrYnwZ779A
        Signing CA: RSA SHA256:euqx2Y8Pq+r0c94GKVNXAklBVTmAJtaQUn3/ehrfEJE (using rsa-sha2-512)
        Key ID: ""
        Serial: 0
        Valid: after 2022-04-22T11:14:16
        Principals: 
                203.0.113.0
        Critical Options: (none)
        Extensions: 
                x-teleport-authority UNKNOWN OPTION (len 33)
                x-teleport-role UNKNOWN OPTION (len 8)
```

Copy the host key and certificate to your `sshd` host, placing them in the
directory `/etc/ssh`.

Make sure these files have the correct permissions:

```code
$ sudo chmod 0600 /etc/ssh/myhost
$ sudo chmod 0600 /etc/ssh/myhost-cert.pub
```

Then add the following lines to `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` on your `sshd` host:

```yaml
HostKey /etc/ssh/myhost
HostCertificate /etc/ssh/myhost-cert.pub
```

Restart `sshd`.

## Step 3 /. Connect to the OpenSSH server

{/* TODO: Add a step showing how you'd connect to the host after going through
the previous steps */}

## Revoke an SSH certificate

{/* TODO: See if there's a better place to put this text */}

To revoke the current Teleport CA and generate a new one, run `tctl auth rotate`. Unless you've highly automated your
infrastructure, we would suggest you proceed with caution as this will invalidate the user
and host CAs, meaning that the new CAs will need to be exported to every OpenSSH-based machine again using `tctl auth export` as above.
