title: Deploying Machine ID
description: How to deploy Machine ID for your environment

Teleport Machine ID provides authentication for machine access to Teleport. This
allows unattended machines (e.g CI/CD workflows) to access resources protected
by Teleport and configure Teleport itself. By using Machine ID, you benefit from
the same rich auditing, fine-grained access control and short-lived certificates
that Teleport provides for human access.

## Background

Machine ID operates through the `tbot` agent. This agent outputs artifacts such
as certificates and configuration files to destinations. These artifacts can
then be read by other tools from the destination and used to access Teleport
resources.

`tbot` authenticates to the Teleport Cluster using a **join token** which is
associated with a **Bot User**. The **Bot User** is assigned a **Bot Role**
which grants it the ability to generate certificates for a specified set of
roles through a process known as role impersonation. This means that credentials
output by Machine ID can be limited to a specific Teleport role - providing a
basis for implementing the principle of least access.

Any Machine ID implementation typically consists of two major parts:
configuring `tbot` for your environment and then configuring outputs to produce
credentials which will grant access to resources your want your machines to
access.

## Configuring `tbot` for your environment

### CI/CD

### Kubernetes

### Linux Hosts

## Configuring outputs

### SSH Access

### Kubernetes Access

### Application Access

### Database Access

### SSH Host Certificates
