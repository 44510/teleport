Teleport Machine ID provides authentication for machine access to Teleport. This
allows unattended machines (e.g CI/CD workflows) to access resources protected
by Teleport and configure Teleport itself.

At the core of Machine ID is the `tbot` agent. This authenticates to your
Teleport cluster using a **join method** and produces outputs such as
credentials and configuration files that other tools can use to access Teleport.

on the specific pages with examples of systemd files or kubernetes manifests.

- CI/CD
- Kubernetes
- Linux Host (SystemD)
