## Best practices and common mistakes

This section highlights best practices and common mistakes to avoid.

### Make every word count

Concise sentences are easier to read, comprehend, and translate.

- Use simple words with precise meanings.
- Remove words that don't add substance.
- Avoid using passive *to be verbs* like *been*, and *being*.
- Avoid weak or vague verbs, such as *have*, *make*, and *do*.

Whenever possible, choose words that have one clear meaning. When in doubt, choose the 
simple word or phrase over a more formal or complex one.
Avoid flowery language and unnecessary words whenever possible.
For example:

| Choose this | Instead of this |
| --- | --- |
| use | utilize, make use of |
| remove | extract, take away, eliminate |
| tell | inform, let know |
| to | in order to, as a means to |
| also | in addition |
| connect | establish connectivity |

Avoid adjectives and adverbs—words that describe how, when, or where. They're tempting, but 
rarely add value. Unless they're important to the meaning of a statement, leave them out.

### Be consistent

Use one term consistently to represent one concept. 
For example, if you use *tenant*, *cluster*, and *proxy* interchangeably or ambiguously, you'll 
leave the reader confused and uncertain. 
If terminology changes, be prepared to root out old terminology.

If you use words that can be both nouns and verbs—for example, words like *file*, *post*, *mark*, 
*screen*, *record*, and *report*—use sentence structure and context to eliminate ambiguity.

### Dangling prepositions

In modern English, it's perfectly acceptable to end a sentence with a preposition. 

- This is something you might be interested in.
- This is an example you should pay attention to.

### Cross-reference formats

Most cross references should include information that clarifies what the reader 
can expect to be found in the referenced topic.
For cross references to topics in the Teleport documentation, use the following 
format:

- For more information about viewing audit logs, see [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting).

For cross references to external resources, use the title of the destination instead 
of the URL of the destination. Avoid using links to unnamed destinations. For example, 
don't use links like click <ins>here</ins> or see this <ins>article</ins>>.
