## Best practices and common mistakes

This section highlights best practices and common mistakes to avoid.

### Make every word count

Concise sentences are easier to read, comprehend, and translate.

- Use simple words with precise meanings.
- Remove words that don't add substance.
- Avoid using passive *to be verbs* like *been*, and *being*.
- Avoid weak or vague verbs, such as *have*, *make*, and *do*.

Whenever possible, choose words that have one clear meaning. When in doubt, choose the 
simple word or phrase over a more formal or complex one.
Avoid flowery language and unnecessary words whenever possible.
For example:

| Choose this | Instead of this |
| --- | --- |
| use | utilize, make use of |
| remove | extract, take away, eliminate |
| tell | inform, let know |
| to | in order to, as a means to |
| also | in addition |
| connect | establish connectivity |

Avoid adjectives and adverbs—words that describe how, when, or where. They're tempting, but 
rarely add much value. Unless they're important to the meaning of a statement, leave them out.

### Be consistent

Use one term consistently to represent one concept. 
For example, if you use tenant, cluster, and proxy interchangeably or ambiguously, you'll 
leave the reader confused and uncertain. 
If terminology changes, be prepared to root out old terminology.

If you use words that can be both nouns and verbs—for example, words like file, post, mark, 
screen, record, and report—use sentence structure and context to eliminate ambiguity.

### Avoid dangling participles

Participles are modifiers so they must have a noun to modify. A *dangling participle* is 
a participle that doesn't have a noun to modify. If you misplace or leave out the word 
being modified, you'll end up with a sentence that is difficult to understand, illogical, 
or ambiguous (though potentially amusing). Here are a few examples of sentences with 
dangling participles:

- Looking around the yard, dandelions sprouted in every corner.
- Walking through the kitchen, the smoke alarm was going off.
- Driving like a maniac, the deer was hit and killed.

You can correct these sentences by bringing the participle phrase closer to the subject 
the phrase is intended to modify or changing the word order of the sentence to clarify 
who is doing what. You can also fix these types of problems by changing the tense or 
using the active voice. For example:

- Looking around the yard, I saw dandelions had sprouted in every corner.
- As I was walking through the kitchen, the smoke alarm was going off.
- Driving like a maniac, he hit and killed the deer.

### Dangling prepositions

In modern English, it's perfectly acceptable to end a sentence with a preposition. 
Don't twist a sentence into knots just to avoid using a preposition at the end.

- This is something you might be interested in.
- This is an example you should pay attention to.

### Cross-reference formats

Most cross-references should include information that clarifies what the reader 
can expect to be found in the referenced topic.
For cross-references to topics in the Teleport documentation, use the following 
format:

- For more information about task or concept, see topic-title-link.

For cross-references in a glossary entry to other glossary entries, use the following 
format:

- See topic.

For cross-references to external resources, use the title of the destination instead 
of the URL of the destination. Avoid using links to unnamed destinations. For example, 
don't use links like click <ins>here</ins> or see this <ins>article</ins>>.
