This guide describes our approach to building effective documentation, 
the conventions we follow, and the recommended practices for organizing, crafting, 
and evolving our information architecture with a clear and consistent voice.

Many style rules have equally justifiable alternatives. Following a common style guide 
is intended to prevent debates over style questions from getting in the way of 
documenting Teleport. If you don't see an answer to a style question in this guide, 
follow your best judgement and keep the style you choose consistent within the 
page you're working on.
