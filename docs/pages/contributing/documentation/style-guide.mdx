title: Style Guide
description: Use this reference to ensure our docs are consistent and effective
---

To keep our documentation effective as Teleport develops, we need to ensure that we maintain a consistent approach to organizing information.

## Kinds of pages

Each documentation page at Teleport falls into one of five categories. Each page
is self contained, and it is okay have duplicate content between different
guides. This is encouraged to promote familiarity with the product.

- **[How-to guides](./style-guide.mdx#how-to-guides)**: Tutorials for intermediate readers who want to set up Teleport for a specific scenario.
- **[Getting started articles](./style-guide.mdx#getting-started-articles)**: Designed to get the user up and running in the quickest way possible.
- **[Architecture guides](./style-guide.mdx#architecture-guides)**: Guides that explain how Teleport works to advanced readers, e.g., architects, DevSecOps engineers, and SREs.
- **[Conceptual guides](./style-guide.mdx#conceptual-guides)**: Explain concepts related to Teleport for users who want a deeper understanding of its functionality.
- **[Reference manuals](./style-guide.mdx#reference-manuals)**: Provide a comprehensive list of configuration options, API methods, metrics, and other ways of interacting with Teleport.

### How-to guides

**How-to guides** are for readers who already have some familiarity with
Teleport and want to set up Teleport for a specific scenario.

#### Expectations

- The introductory section should state the utility of completing the article.

- Do not recreate content across guides when it is possible to refer a reader to
  a single, separate guide. Actions that are prerequisites to several topics but
  *not* directly related to those topics should be documented in a single
  location and referenced in a **Prerequisites** section at the top of the page. 

- Do not break the reader's focus. Do not link the reader to another page—or
  even another section within the same page—when it is possible to include the
  same content in the current paragraph or section.

  You can include a link in the body text of a how-to guide as long as you tell
  the reader why to follow the link and what information to glean from it.
  "Follow the installation instructions in the AWS documentation" does this,
  while "Read the AWS documentation for more information" does not.

- Example code and configurations should be complete and pastable.

- Each step is clearly stated so users can easily follow the sequence. Section
  headings should have a format similar to "Step 1/3. Add a local user"

#### Example outline

- Guide title: "Access Kubernetes on GKE"
- The purpose of the guide
- Prerequisites
- Setup steps
- Next steps

### Getting started articles

**Getting started guides** are designed to get a user up and running in the
shortest way possible. They are intended for first-time Teleport users, and are
often one of the first interactions they will have with the product. They should
be fun and stress free.

<Admonition type="note">
  "Getting started" is a better term than "Quickstart".
  Google "Getting started with React" vs. "React quickstart"
  and compare the search results.
</Admonition>

#### Expectations

Getting started articles have the same expectations as how-to guides, plus the
following:

- It should be possible to complete the tutorial in 5–10 minutes.
- Consider including a demo video in order to reach readers who prefer video.

#### Example outline

- Title: "SSO and Audit for Kubernetes in three steps"
- Demo video
- Prerequisites section: lists the tools used in the guide
- Several sub-sections describing concrete steps that a user can verify they have completed
- Wrap up with "Next steps" section.

### Architecture guides

**Architecture guides** explain how Teleport works to advanced readers, e.g.,
architects, DevSecOps engineers, and SREs. They describe high-level concepts
with a narrow focus on architectural concerns, and are used to evaluate
architectural decisions, configuration, and usage scenarios.

Specific kinds of architecture guides include:

- **Networking**: Readers are interested in learning about specific ports, components, and protocols that are or can be used.
- **Security**: Lists security protocols and primitives. SecOps will look for an attack vector tree diagram.
- **Deployment**: Should include a deployment diagram which in turn explains components and how they interact with databases and each other.

### Conceptual guides

**Conceptual guides** are a continuations of our architectural guides and distinct from how-to guides. They explain a concept that is relevant for understanding Teleport. Some overlap will be likely between conceptual guides and architecture guides.

### Reference manuals

**Reference manuals** provide an exhaustive list of configuration options, API methods, and other possible fields and values for the various ways in which users can interact with Teleport.

#### Expectations
- Should be comprehensive. If listing configuration options, API paths, and so on, list all of them, rather than a few examples.
- HTML or Markdown tables are often the best formats for this kind of article .
- Should be easy to navigate with a browser's search functionality. List all content on the same page.
- Should avoid prose and be expressed with brevity.

## General guidance for engaging content

There are three keys to writing content that engages the audience:

- Use the *second person* point of view to directly address the reader.
- Use an *active voice* and *present tense* whenever possible.
- Use a *conversational tone* that is not too formal or too chummy.

### Point of view

In most cases, address the reader directly. For tutorials, use either first person 
plural—we, us, our, ours—or second person point of view. Because tutorials provide a 
more guided approach to a topic, using the first person plural is a more natural and 
commonly-accepted practice than in other types of documentation.

Use the first person point of view sparingly and with intention. When overused, the 
first person narrative can overwhelm the sense of a shared experience and obscure the 
reader's journey.

Don't use “I” or “me” unless it appears in the text of a user interface element.

Avoid using “we” unless you have a really good rationale for it. For example, if you 
are documenting a recommended setting or practice, using “We recommend...” is ambiguous
("we" being who exactly?) and potentially dangerous if something goes wrong. If there
are industry best practices or recommendations, it's okay to indicate that instead of 
using the royal or editorial "we" in documentation.

### Passive constructions

In spite of the axiom to never use the passive voice, there are situations where a 
passive sentence structure might be appropriate. Don't twist a sentence into knots just 
to avoid a passive construction. Passive voice does have its place, but be wary of using it.

When writing about software, it's often tempting to describe what's happening from the 
code point of view. However, there's almost always a human being with a goal or task to 
complete who is initiating the activity that the software is executing. If you keep this 
human presence in mind, your writing will be more dynamic, easier to follow, and more 
interesting to read.

### Contractions and conversational tone

Contractions are generally acceptable because they give documentation a more natural 
conversational tone—at least for English speakers. Be conscious of when and why you use 
contractions.

To keep the tone conversational but concise, adhere to the following common-sense guidelines:

- Use common, well-known words whenever possible.

- Don't use flowery language or literary flourish words and phrases like “and so forth”, 
  “albeit”, “heretofore”, or “thus”.

- Try to be precise in word choice. For example:

  - Don't use “when”—implying eventuality and time—as interchangeable with “if”, which implies 
    the possibility of something happening.
  - Don't use phrases that introduce ambiguity. For example, instead of “When the process completes…” 
    use “After the process completes…”.
  - Think carefully about word choices like using “since” (implying a period of time) instead 
    of “because” (implying cause and result) or using “once” (single occurrence) instead of 
    “after” (each time).

- Avoid using dead language words and phrases even if they are generally accepted as English 
  words in practice. For example:

  - Instead of “i.e.”, use “that is” or rewrite the sentence to make the meaning clear without 
    needing extra qualification.
  - Instead of “e.g.”, use “for example”.
  - Instead of “via”, use an appropriate English substitute such as “by”, “through”, 
    "from", or “using”.
  - Instead of “etc.”, use “and so on” or revise the content to make the term unnecessary. 
    For example, revise to use *such as* or *like* followed by an example or two.
  - Instead of “caveat”, use an appropriate English substitute such as “notice”, 
    “caution”, or “warning”.

- Avoid adding unnecessary words or phrases. For example:

  - Instead of “In order to”, just use “to”.
  - Instead of “as well as”, just use “and”.
  - Instead of “and then”, just use “then”.
  - Avoid jargon, colloquialisms, and idiomatic phrases.

- Avoid adverbs and subjective statements. For example, don't use words and phrases like 
  easily, rapidly, simply, quickly.

  - Experienced developers who ~~truly~~ prefer to skip the tutorial...
  - We can ~~quickly~~ test this code is functioning as expected...

### Headings

All heading levels should use the following conventions:

- Use sentence case. Sentence case means that only the initial word and proper nouns are 
  capitalized.
- Use active, present tense verbs in headings wherever appropriate, especially in the 
  context of tutorials and how-to guides.
- Use noun phrases for conceptual and reference topics whenever possible.
- Summarize as succinctly as possible the content they contain.
- Avoid generic headings like overview and introduction, if possible. While generic 
  headings can be conceptually useful, they add no value to the content or the navigational 
  experience.
- Always contain content. A heading should never be immediately followed by another 
  heading. As a best practice, avoid using headings strictly for navigation.

### Limit heading levels

As a best practice, avoid building an information hierarchy with more than three heading 
levels. Most content can be effectively organized using two internal heading levels, making 
it easier to navigate and scan for relevant topics. 

### Topic titles

Avoid using gerunds (verbs ending in -ing) in titles and headings. Procedure titles and 
headings should answer the question: *What are you trying to do?* For example, if the answer 
to *What are you trying to do?* is *I want to create an account*, the article heading 
should be *Create an account*. In most cases, concept and reference topics that aren't 
related to tasks are named with a noun phrase, such as *Trusted clusters*. 

### Lists

Introduce lists with a heading, a sentence, or a fragment that ends with a colon. 

- Use **bulleted lists** for items that don't need to appear in order. Make all list 
  items parallel in structure. For example, start each item in the list using a noun 
  or a phrase that starts with a verb.
- Use **numbered lists** only for processes and procedures that must be completed in 
  sequential order.

### Bullets

Bullets are for unordered lists. The order of items in a bulleted list can imply 
importance, but generally all list items are peers. Each list item should start with 
a capital letter and end with a period unless all of the list items are single words 
or short phrases of no more than four words. Use parallel structure in phrasing the 
items in a list. For example, each list item might start with a verb, noun, or gerund. 

### Numbered steps

Only use numbered paragraphs for steps in procedures. If a procedure has more than nine steps, 
always consider breaking it into subsections with headings. Ideally, each procedure or subtask 
should be three to six steps, not have nested sub-steps, and have minimal embedded paragraphs 
describing what happens—the result or outcome to expect—in an unnumbered paragraph following 
the step. 

### Pronouns

Use gender-neutral pronouns, like “they” whenever possible. Generally, you can change any 
noun from singular to plural to have subject-verb-pronoun agreement and avoid the use of 
gender-specific pronouns like “he”, “him”, “his” or “she”, “her”, “hers”. Using "they" or 
"their" with singular nouns is more generally accepted in modern conversational English, but
it's rare you to need to use the disagreeing format in documentation.

Be wary of impersonal and potentially ambiguous pronouns such as:

- all, another, any
- each, either
- few, many, neither, none,
- one, other
- same, several, some, such
- this, that, them, these, those

If you use any of these impersonal pronouns, be sure you answer “of what?”, “of which?”, 
or “as what?” in the sentence. Be especially cautious if you start a sentence with an
indefinite pronoun like "This" followed by a verb. In most cases, the pronoun should be 
followed by an object.

## Teleport-specific styles

Many style rules have equally justifiable alternatives. Following a common style guide 
is intended to prevent debates over style questions from getting in the way of 
documenting Teleport. If you don't see an answer to a style question in this guide, 
follow your best judgement and keep the style you choose consistent within the 
page you're working on to maintain a professional polish.

### Tone

The documentation should be technically precise and directed toward a generally 
technical audience, for example, application developers, site reliability engineers, 
and security engineering team leads. 

Even when describing Teleport generally, emphasize specific technical capabilities 
over broad statements of benefit. The aim is not to pique the audience's interest, but 
to provide information.

For example, rather than:

```markdown
Teleport replaces insecure secrets with true identity.
```

Use:

```markdown
Teleport replaces shared secrets with short-lived X.509 and SSH certificates.
```

Some guides are intended for end users seeking to access resources in their
cluster. For certain use cases, it may be necessary to adjust our usual voice
for the audience of a specific guide.

### Code, commands, and configuration

- `tsh`, `tctl`, and other core commands should be placed in backticks.

- All ports or values should be enclosed in backticks, for example, `443`.

- Put shell commands and scripts into full-line code snippets so that 
  they render with a Copy button. For example:

   ```code
   $ echo "This is an example."
   ```

### Diagrams

- Use the [Teleport Lucidchart library](https://app.lucidchart.com/lucidchart/dfcf1f4a-5cf0-4758-8ebb-f6ea86900aba/edit) to create diagrams with a consistent design language.
- Diagram multistep sections using sequence diagrams that depict steps linearly.
- Several examples are available here: https://gravitational.slab.com/posts/diagrams-ix9nzhpd.

### Product names

- Full product names are treated as proper nouns and capitalized. 
  For example, Teleport Auth Service and Teleport Proxy Service are proper nouns.
  The terms proxy and service are common words and not proper nouns.
  In general, avoid capitalizing terms and features. For example, don't capitalize 
  common terms like server, node, agent, and so on. Overuse of capitalization
  makes text more difficult to read.
- Don't use quotes to refer to product names.
- Product proper nouns should be bolded on first use.

### Technical concepts and acronyms

- Avoid using acronyms whenever possible.
- If you use acronyms, be consistent and use the same acronym for any given
  concept throughout the entire page. For example, don't use a combination 
  of "multifactor", "2-factor," "two-factor", "2fa," or "tfa" within a given page.
- Always use the full definition followed by the acronym in parentheses before using 
  the acronym thereafter. For example, use "Network Level Authentication (NLA)"", not
  "NLA (Network Level Authentication)"" or "NLA" on its own without its full definition. 

### Page titles

- Should follow a `Title Name | Teleport Docs` format. The `| Teleport Docs` suffix 
  is added automatically by the static site generator.
- The total character count should not exceed 70 for the entire title since this can 
  impact SEO. Including the suffix `| Teleport Docs`, that leaves 55 characters for 
  the article's title.

### SEO

- Every page should have a clearly-worded description that summarizes the content.
- Descriptions should start with a verb and end with a period.
- Description should include common keywords related to the subject matter whenever 
  possible. 
- Use keywords liberally throughout the article.

### Videos

- If you use macOS, you can record short videos with the Quicktime
 Cmd-Shift-5 key combination and embed the video in a page with the following
 Markdown:

  ![quicktime](../../../img/docs/quicktime.webp)

- Convert `.mov` videos to `.mp4` and `webm`.

  Quicktime outputs large `.mov` files. Use `ffmpeg` to convert them into `mp4` and `webm`
  web-friendly formats:

  ```code
  # create MP4
  $ ffmpeg -i input.mov -b:v 0 -crf 25 output.mp4
  # create WebM
  $ ffmpeg -i input.mov -c vp9 -b:v 0 -crf 41 output.webm
  ```
