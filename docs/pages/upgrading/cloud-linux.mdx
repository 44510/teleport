title: Upgrade Teleport Cloud Agents on Linux
description: Provides instructions for upgrading Teleport Cloud agents that run on Linux servers. 
---

This guide explains how to upgrade Teleport Cloud agents running on Linux servers.
To keep agents up to date, you can either perform:
- [Automatic updates](#automatic-updates) (recommended)
- [Manual updates](#manual-updates)

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with the [Upgrading Compatibility Overview](./overview.mdx) guide,
  which describes the sequence in which to upgrade components in your cluster.

- (!docs/pages/includes/cloud/tctl-tsh-prerequisite.mdx!)

- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)

## Check for agent updates

The latest compatible Teleport agent version is served by the Teleport Proxy. To
identify what that version is, you can query the `webapi` endpoint.
```code
$ curl https://<Var name="teleport.example.com" />/webapi/automaticupgrades/channel/stable/cloud/version
v15.2.1
```

To list the agents that are upgradable, use the `tctl inventory ls` command to list
the inventory of connected agents. The agents are listed along with their current
version. Additional flags are available to filter by service `--services=node,kube,db,...`,
or to filter by version `--older-than=v15.2.1`.
```code
$ tctl inventory ls --older-than=v15.2.1
Server ID                            Hostname       Services       Version Upgrader
------------------------------------ -------------- -------------- ------- --------
00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 ip-10-1-6-130  Node           v14.4.5 none
00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001 teleport-proxy Proxy          v15.2.0 none
00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000002 teleport-auth  Auth,Discovery v15.2.0 none
...
```
Note that the `inventory ls` command will also list `teleport-auth` and `teleport-proxy`
services. These services are managed by the Teleport Cloud team and updates will
be performed automatically.

## Automatic updates

Agents enrolled in automatic updates will automatically be kept up to date with the
latest compatible version of Teleport. You can find more information regarding the
automatic updates architecture in the [Agent Update Management](../architecture/agent-update-management.mdx)
page.

New Teleport agents are installed with automatic updates enabled by default. Agents
that have existed prior to the release of Teleport 13, however, are not automatically
enrolled in automatic updates. These agents must be manually enrolled in automatic
updates.

### Find agents to enroll in automatic updates

To identify the agents that are not enrolled in automatic updates, use the `tctl inventory ls`
command again. The command accepts an additional `--upgrader=none` flag that can
be used to filter only the agents that are not enrolled in automatic updates.
```code
$ tctl inventory ls --upgrader=none
Server ID                            Hostname      Services Version Upgrader
------------------------------------ ------------- -------- ------- --------
00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 ip-10-1-6-130 Node     v14.4.5 none
...
```

For each agent ID returned by the `tctl inventory ls` command, copy the ID and
run the following `tctl` command to access the host via `tsh`:

```code
$ HOST=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
$ USER=root
$ tsh ssh "${USER?}@${HOST?}"
```

### Enroll agents in automatic updates

Ensure that the Teleport repository is properly configured to use the `stable/cloud`
channel, and install the `teleport-ent-updater` package. This must be completed on
each agent you would like to enroll into automatic updates.

(!docs/pages/includes/cloud/install-linux-cloud.mdx!)

### Run as non-root (optional)

If you changed the agent user to run as non-root, create `/etc/teleport-upgrade.d/schedule`
and grant ownership to your Teleport user. Otherwise, you can skip this step:

```code
$ sudo mkdir -p /etc/teleport-upgrade.d/
$ sudo touch /etc/teleport-upgrade.d/schedule
$ sudo chown <your-teleport-user> /etc/teleport-upgrade.d/schedule
```

## Manual updates

[Automatic updates](#automatic-updates) is the recommended update method for Teleport
agents. If you choose to opt out of automatic updates, you will need to be responsible
for keeping your Teleport agents up to date with the version of Teleport Cloud.

## FAQ

### Version locking

As of Teleport `15.1.10`, a version locking mechanism is enabled by the updater.
This mechanism locks the version of Teleport and prevents manual updates of the Teleport
package. This prevents unintentional updates during routine system maintenance, or
an accidental update by a user. The updater still has the capability to update the
Teleport package, and all updates of Teleport are expected to be performed by the
updater.

The version locking mechanism is implemented using the features of the package managers.
In case a user would like to manually update the Teleport version, this can be done
with the following commands.

With the `apt` package manager CLI, the `--allow-change-held-packages` flag must be provided
to bypass the version lock.
```code
$ apt-get install --allow-change-held-packages "teleport-ent=<target-version>"
```

With the `yum` package manager CLI, the `--disableexcludes="teleport"` flag must be provided
to bypass the version lock.
```code
$ yum install --disablerepo="*" --enablerepo="teleport" --disableexcludes="teleport" "teleport-ent-<target-version>"
```

With the `zypper` package manager CLI, the lock must be disabled and then re-enabled
after the update.
```code
$ zypper removelock "teleport-ent"
$ zypper install --repo="teleport" "teleport-ent-<target-version>"
$ zypper addlock "teleport-ent"
```

### Automatic updates with direct binary installation

Automatic updates is not currently supported with the direct binary installation method.
Automatic updates is only supported with installations via the `apt`, `yum`, and
`zypper` package managers.

### Updating the updater

The updater is designed to be minimal and relatively stable, but the updater will
receive updates on occasion. Currently, the updater does not have the capability
to update itself. Updates to the `teleport-ent-updater` package must be done manually.

The `teleport-ent-updater` will be backwards compatible with older versions of Teleport,
so you can always update the `teleport-ent-updater` package to the latest available
version.

### Automatic updates with Teleport OSS

Automatic updates is not currently supported with OSS editions of Teleport. Ensure
that you are using `teleport-ent` package, which is the Teleport Enterprise edition
of Teleport.

## Troubleshooting

The `teleport-upgrade` tool provides some basic commands to verify and perform an
update of the Teleport agent.

```code
$ teleport-upgrade help
USAGE: /usr/sbin/teleport-upgrade <command>

Tool for automatic upgrades of Teleport agents.

Commands:
  run           check for and potentially apply a teleport upgrade.
  dry-run       check for new teleport version but do not upgrade.
  version       print the current version of /usr/sbin/teleport-upgrade.
  help          show this help text.
```

The `dry-run` command can be used to check for an available update without performing
an update.
```code
# Example output when teleport is already on the latest compatible version.
$ teleport-upgrade dry-run
[i] no upgrades available (14.3.14 == 14.3.14) [ 582 ]

# Example output when an update is available.
$ teleport-upgrade dry-run
[i] an upgrade is available (13.4.14 -> 14.3.14) [ 585 ]
[i] within maintenance window, upgrade will be attempted. [ 596 ]
```

The `run` command performs an update if available.
```code
# Successful teleport update from 13.4.14 to 14.3.14.
$ teleport-upgrade run
[i] an upgrade is available (13.4.14 -> 14.3.14) [ 585 ]
[i] within maintenance window, upgrade will be attempted. [ 596 ]
[i] attempting apt install teleport-ent=14.3.14... [ 480 ]
[...]
[i] gracefully restarting Teleport (if already running) [ 449 ]

# Teleport updates are not attempted when outside the maintenance window.
$ teleport-upgrade run
[i] an upgrade is available (13.4.14 -> 14.3.14) [ 585 ]
[i] upgrade is non-critical and we are outside of maintenance window, not attempting. [ 618 ]
```

Teleport agents are not updated immediately when a new version of Teleport is released,
and agent updates can lag behind the cluster by a few days.

If the Teleport agent has not been automatically updating for several weeks, you
can view the logs of the `teleport-upgrade.service` to help troubleshoot the problem.

```code
$ journalctl -t teleport-upgrade
Apr 16 16:44:32 example teleport-upgrade[168983]: [i] upgrade is non-critical and we are outside of maintenance window, not attempting. [ 618 ]
Apr 16 16:50:32 example teleport-upgrade[169084]: [i] an upgrade is available (13.4.14 -> 14.3.14) [ 585 ]
Apr 16 16:50:33 example teleport-upgrade[169084]: [i] upgrade is non-critical and we are outside of maintenance window, not attempting. [ 618 ]
Apr 16 16:56:32 example teleport-upgrade[169187]: [i] an upgrade is available (13.4.14 -> 14.3.14) [ 585 ]
...
```

To suspend automatic updates, disable the `teleport.upgrade.timer` systemd timer:

```code
$ sudo systemctl disable --now teleport-upgrade.timer
```

To enable and start the systemd timer after suspending:

```code
$ sudo systemctl enable --now teleport-upgrade.timer
```
