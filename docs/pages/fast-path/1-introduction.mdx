title: Fast Path to Teleport
description: Quickly deploy a Teleport cluster, register resources, and configure RBAC and single-sign.
---

The Fast Path to Teleport is a series of guides that demonstrate how to quickly
protect your infrastructure with a self-hosted, open source Teleport deployment.

At the end of this series, which takes less than an hour to complete, you will
have:
- A role-based access control system with three different levels of access to a
  Kubernetes cluster. 
- The ability for users to authenticate to your Kubernetes cluster via GitHub.
- Automatic assignment of users to levels of access to your cluster based on
  their GitHub teams.

## Prerequisites

- A registered domain name. Teleport users will use the domain in order to
  connect to resources in your infrastructure via the Teleport CLI and Web UI.
  Resources in your infrastructure will use this domain name in order to
  register themselves with Teleport.
- An Amazon Web Services account.
- A [Spacelift](https://spacelift.io/) account.
- A GitHub repository with permissions to create teams and single sign-on
  applications.
- An Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service cluster where you will run the Teleport
  Auth Service, Proxy Service, and Kubernetes Service. 

  <Details title="Set up an EKS cluster to follow this guide">

  If you do not have an EKS cluster, but do have an AWS account, you can use the
  `eksctl` tool to set up a cluster quickly in a demo environment. 

  <Notice type="warning">

  For production, you will want to consult with your organization and determine
  how best to set up an EKS cluster. Setting up EKS for production is outside
  the scope of this guide.

  </Notice>

  In order to use `eksctl`, you must have permissions to create an EKS cluster
  and its associated resources (e.g., IAM roles and a virtual private cloud) via
  AWS CloudFormation.

  Install `eksctl` for your environment by following the [AWS
  documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/eksctl.html).

  Ensure that you have configured [AWS credentials for your
  environment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html),
  e.g., by setting the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, and
  `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` environment variables.

  Run the following command to generate an EKS cluster:

  ```code
  $ eksctl create cluster --name <Var name="cluster-name" /> --region <Var name="aws-region" />
  ```

  Note that it will take 10-20 minutes for the cluster to spin up.

<Notice type="tip">

We have designed this guide to work for most Teleport users. If it is not
possible to follow this guide in your environment, you can use it as an example
for setting up a full Teleport deployment, then consult the rest of our
documentation to find an approach that works for you.

## Architecture

{/* TODO: Explain the architecture of the deployment we will set up, including
with a Mermaid chart*/}

## Principles

In this series, we will demonstrate an approach that takes advantage of two
principles that help you manage your infrastructure security more efficiently as
well as more confidently:

- **Infrastructure as code:** With Teleport, you can define configuration
  documents that define role-based access controls, protect specific resources,
  set up single sign-on, and more. 

  By declaring these documents alongside code for deploying other resources in
  your infrastructure, you can document your entire system, including its
  security policies, in one place. In the Fast Path to Teleport, we will show
  you how to deploy Teleport and apply configurations using Terraform.

- **GitOPs:** Since you can manage Teleport deployments as code, you automate
  them based on your source control repository. You can set up a continuous
  deployment pipeline that modifies your infrastructure security policies when
  you merge changes into your repo. In this series, we will show you how to set
  up Spacelift to manage your Teleport Terraform configuration.

   Teleport.
