title: Fast Path to Teleport
description: Quickly deploy a Teleport cluster, register resources, and configure RBAC and single-sign.
---

The Fast Path to Teleport is a series of guides that demonstrate how to quickly
protect your infrastructure with a self-hosted, open source Teleport deployment.

At the end of this series, which takes less than an hour to complete, you will
have:
- A role-based access control system with three different levels of access to a
  Kubernetes cluster. 
- The ability for users to authenticate to your Kubernetes cluster via GitHub.
- Automatic assignment of users to levels of access to your cluster based on
  their GitHub teams.

## Before you begin

### Prerequisites

- An Amazon Web Services account.
- A [Spacelift](https://spacelift.io/) account.
- A GitHub repository with permissions to create teams and single sign-on
  applications.

<Notice type="tip">

We have designed this guide to work for most Teleport users. If it is not
possible to follow this guide in your environment, you can use it as an example
for setting up a full Teleport deployment, then consult the rest of our
documentation to find an approach that works for you.

### Architecture

{/* TODO: Explain the architecture of the deployment we will set up, including
with a Mermaid chart*/}

### Principles

In this series, we will demonstrate an approach that takes advantage of two
principles that help you manage your infrastructure security more efficiently as
well as more confidently:

- **Infrastructure as code:** With Teleport, you can define configuration
  documents that define role-based access controls, protect specific resources,
  set up single sign-on, and more. 

  By declaring these documents alongside code for deploying other resources in
  your infrastructure, you can document your entire system, including its
  security policies, in one place. In the Fast Path to Teleport, we will show
  you how to deploy Teleport and apply configurations using Terraform.

- **GitOPs:** Since you can manage Teleport deployments as code, you automate
  them based on your source control repository. You can set up a continuous
  deployment pipeline that modifies your infrastructure security policies when
  you merge changes into your repo. In this series, we will show you how to set
  up Spacelift to manage your Teleport Terraform configuration.

   Preparatory steps to ensure that your GitOps solution and EKS cluster support
   Teleport.
