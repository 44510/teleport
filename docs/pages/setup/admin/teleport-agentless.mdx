description: Explaining agentless mode and agent mode for resource services.

Teleport manages access to resources in your cluster using **resource
services**, such as the SSH Service, Kubernetes Service, and Database Service.
This guide will the configurations you can use to run Teleport's resource
services within your cluster, including in **agentless mode** and in **agent
mode**.

In general, all of Teleport's resource services must run on the same _network_
as the resources they manage, but not on the same _host_. This gives you have
two options for deploying resource services, which we will introduce in more
detail in this guide:

{/* TODO: Add diagrams to explain each mode */}

- **Agentless mode:** You can deploy one resource service—or a small pool of
  resource services—in the same data center (or network) as your infrastructure.
  This minimizes the resource utilization of your resource services while
  reducing their capacity to handle client traffic.

  With Teleport in agentless mode, you can easily control access to SSH servers,
  Kubernetes clusters, databases and internal applications without running any
  additional software on your servers. Agentless mode supports session
  recordings and audit logs for deep understanding into user behavior.

- **Agent mode:** You can deploy a single `teleport` daemon within the same host
  or Kubernetes pod as the application, database, or other resource it protects.

  For capabilities such as kernel-level logging and user provisioning, we
  recommend Teleport as a drop-in replacement for OpenSSH. Since Teleport
  replaces the OpenSSH agent while preserving OpenSSH functionality, you get
  deeper analytics without a net addition of an agent on your system.

## Agentless mode


{/* TODO How to make this work for each service: add a Tabs component with a
TabItem for each service:

- explaining how agentless mode works for that service
- including an example config 
- when you would want to use agentless mode for that service
- A diagram if needed

{/* TODO: How would a pool of resource services work? Are these services
stateless? If you deploy them behind a load balancer, would the load balancer
need to terminate TLS? **It depends on the service!** /}

{/* TODO RE: the SSH service, talk about running
without a resource service */}

{/* TODO: Note that you can also deploy resource services in the same `teleport` process as the Auth/Proxy, but that process _must_ include both the Auth and Proxy: https://gravitational.slack.com/archives/C01TYKHFVTQ/p1655396993351109?thread_ts=1655396125.961999&cid=C01TYKHFVTQ */}

the one that comes to mind */}
