In this section, you can find guides on managing a Teleport cluster after
deploying it.

## Use infrastructure as code

In Teleport, **dynamic resources** let you adjust the behavior of your Teleport
cluster as your infrastructure changes. 

The Teleport Auth Service stores dynamic resources on its backend and exposes a
gRPC API for managing these resources.  This means that you can configure roles,
users, Single Sign-On providers, and other resources using
infrastructure-as-code tools like Terraform and Helm, in addition to Teleport's
own `tctl` CLI.

Read [Using Dynamic Resources](./dynamic-resources.mdx) for more information.

## Export audit events

The Teleport Auth Service maintains an audit log that tracks events in your
cluster, such when a user begins an SSH session or attempts to authenticate. You
can get insight into how users are interacting with your Teleport cluster by
exporting audit events to your log management solution. See how in the
[Exporting Audit Events](./export-audit-events.mdx) guides.

## All topics

your cluster after the initial deployment
