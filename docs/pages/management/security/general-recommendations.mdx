many of these security concerns by using Teleport Team or Teleport Cloud Enterprise.

- Use specific role combinations to assign users the least privilege.
- Consider separating people from roles to ensure checks and balance.
- Consider all system-level access carefully.
- Require multifactor authentication.
- Consider the use of IP address pinning.
- Consider the use of moderated sessions.
- Enroll devices and configure device trust.
