title: "AWS Multi-Region Active-Passive Architecture Deployment"
description: "Deploying a high-availability Teleport cluster in two AWS regions."
---

For mission-critical Teleport use cases, it is recommended to use the architecture described in this 
section, which is highly available across multiple regions. This architecture keeps Teleport 
accessible with minimal disruption during the event of  an entire cloud provider region outage. 
While this example is for AWS, the general architecture can apply to various cloud providers and 
self-hosted examples as well.

In this architecture, the Auth and Proxy components and their networking components run 
parallelly in two different cloud regions. These separate Teleport clusters share a shared storage 
backends for the cluster state, audit logs, and shared storage for session recordings. The DNS failover
is the control point to switch between the active and passive clusters during the event of a regional outage.


## Key components of an Active-Passive Multi-region deployment:

- Two teleport clusters deployed in separate regions. For ex: us-west-1 and us-east-1.
- All teleport cluster components deploued as autoscaling groups in both regions.
- For this example, the us-west-1 region Teleport cluster is the Active cluster, and the us-west-1 region Teleport 
  cluster is the Passive cluster.
- DynamoDB for cluster state and audit log storage, and S3 buckets for session recording storage.
  - Enable the us-west-1 DynamoDB table with global replication in the us-east-1 passive region to ensure cluster 
    state and audit logs are maintained in both regions.
  - Enable cross-region replication on the S3 bucket to ensure objects are replicated between both the active and 
    passive regions.
- configure the Teleport cluster Route53 records to use the [failover routing policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-types.html#dns-failover-types-active-passive).

  with the active cluster end point as Primary Record and Passive cluster endpoint as the secondary record.
  - Using health checks to determine Teleport cluster availability, Route53 will automatically send the traffic to the 
    passive cluster during the event of a regional outage and it will automatically routes the traffic back to the active 
    cluster once the Active cluster when health checks report a normal state.
- [DynamoDB Global Replication](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-convert-your-single-region-amazon-dynamodb-tables-to-global-tables/) 
- [S3 Replication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/replication.html).
- Make sure proper IAM permissions are in place for the successful replication of 
  [S3 buckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/setting-repl-config-perm-overview.html).

## Advantages of this deployment architecture

- Multi-region deploument helps to reduce the latency even if the resources are far away from the user location.
- Having a cluster in multi-regions makes the clusters highly available even during regional outages
- VPC peering or a Transit Gateway is not required since the cluster to cluster communication happens through
  reverse proxy tunnel.
- Using a user/Resource cluster topology allows for users to have a single Teleport cluster login point to 
  access all resources.
- All required Teleport components can be provisioned within the AWS ecosystem.


## Disadvantages of this deployment architecture

- Long-term cost may be a prohibitive factor for some organizations and can increase total cost of ownership
  (TCO) throughout the system's lifetime cycle.
- Deploying and maintaining the added layer of clusters takes more engineering effort.
- More technically complex to deploy than a single region Teleport cluster.

## Prerequisites

Our code requires Terraform 0.13+. You can [download Terraform here](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html). We will assume that you have
`terraform` installed and available on your path.

```code
$ which terraform
/usr/local/bin/terraform
$ terraform version
Terraform v1.2.6
```
## Step 1/7. Set up Teleport cluster in us-west-1 region:
- [Running an HA Teleport cluster using AWS, EKS, Helm](https://goteleport.com/docs/deploy-a-cluster/helm-deployments/aws/)
- Configure [Single Sing-on] (https://goteleport.com/docs/access-controls/sso/) and test your access to cluster.

## Step 2/7. Setup DynamoDB & S3 Global replication to region us-east-1:
- Check the Key components section of this document for Global replication.

## Step 3/7. Set up Teleport cluster in us-east-1 region as per Step 1/7:
- We will use same `aws-values.yaml` & `aws-issuer.yaml` config to install Teleport name space on us-east-1 by changing the clusterName.
  So that it will use same backend as defined in us-west-1 region for DynamoDB and S3 buckets. 
  Once the Teleport us-east-1 cluster is ready, you can check the SSO access by logging in via us-east-1 UI/tsh
  confim SSO is working from both the us-west-1 and us-east-1 Teleport clusters.

## Step 3/7. Set up Teleport cluster in us-east-1 region as per Step 1/7:
- We will enable kube `operatorEnabled: true` in `aws-values.yaml` and update the Teleport us-west-1 cluster using helm update
  Again, confim SSO is working from both the us-west-1 and us-east-1 Teleport clusters.

<Notice type="warning">

With DynamoDB, the kube operator supports >2 pod replicas only per cluster. This restriction for all Teleport clusters with DynamoDB 
with or with out kube operator.
We support multiple auth replicas. The operator sidecar elects a leader with a Kubernetes lease
if both operators sidecars are not in the same Kubernetes cluster and namespace they can't elect a leader. 
Without leader election they will fight against each other and harm Teleport's availability
If we enable kube operator for some on two clusters at a time then Teleport conflicts among both clusters and results in no availabilty.
They can disable the operator on the backup region, then perform a pod rollout on the primary region. When the operator starts, 
it deletes the existing operator bot user, and re-creates all required resources.
