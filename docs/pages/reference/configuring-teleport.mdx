title: Configuring Teleport
description: Contains reference guides for setting up your Teleport cluster.
---

There are two ways to configure a Teleport cluster: 
- **Dynamic resources:** Configuration objects that administrators can apply
  remotely and change without restarting Teleport. You can manage dynamic
  resources with [Infrastructure as Code
  tools](../admin-guides/infrastructure-as-code.mdx).
- **Static configuration files:** Files that a Teleport process reads on
  startup. Teleport agents, Auth Service instances, and Proxy Service instances
  read static configuration files, though Auth Service and Proxy Service
  configuration files are only available to edit in self-hosted Teleport
  clusters.

## Static configuration files

Read the [Configuration Reference](./configuring-teleport/config.mdx) for a
guide to static configuration fields.
