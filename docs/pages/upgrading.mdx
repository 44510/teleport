Teleport components need to be updated regularly to stay up to date with the latest
features and security updates. Teleport releases a new major version every 4 months.
See the [Upcoming Releases](./upcoming-releases.mdx) page to view upcoming changes
and releases.

## Upgrading guides

Before starting one of the following guides, please read the [Upgrading Compatibility Overview](./upgrading/overview.mdx)
to understand how to upgrade components in your Teleport cluster while ensuring ensuring
compatibility between all components.

The Teleport upgrade process is different for Teleport Cloud and self-hosted deployments.
Choose the guide that matches your Teleport edition and the platform where you run Teleport
services:

## Teleport Cloud

Automatic updates is the recommended method for updating Teleport Cloud agents.

- [Linux Servers](./upgrading/cloud-linux-automatic.mdx) (automatic updates)
- [Kubernetes](./upgrading/cloud-kubernetes-automatic.mdx) (automatic updates)

Manual updates are not recommended. If you opt out of automatic updates, you must
ensure that your Teleport agents are routinely updated, and you must ensure that
your Teleport agents maintain compatibility with the Teleport Auth and Proxy Services.

- [Linux Server](./upgrading/cloud-linux.mdx)
- [Kubernetes](./upgrading/cloud-kubernetes.mdx)

You can find more information regarding the automatic updates architecture in the
[Agent Update Management](./architecture/agent-update-management.mdx) page.

## Self-hosted deployments:

- [Linux Servers](./upgrading/self-hosted-linux.mdx)
- [Linux Servers](./upgrading/self-hosted-automatic-agent-updates.mdx) (automatic updates)
- [Kubernetes](./upgrading/self-hosted-kubernetes.mdx)
