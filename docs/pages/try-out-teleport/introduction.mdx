You can set up a quick demo environment to see how Teleport works. We have a
number of ways to get started with Teleport quickly, so choose the best one for
you.

## Browser labs

Try out Teleport in your browser without setting up any infrastructure. 

[Check out our browser labs](./browser-labs.mdx).

## Demo deployments

You can set up a small-scale deployment of Teleport that you can use to manage
access to your home lab or demo project. Once you have set up your demo
deployment, you can use it to add resources, set up RBAC, and enjoy the secure
access Teleport provides to your infrastructure:

- [Try out Open Source Teleport on a Linux Server](./linux-server.mdx)
- [Use the 1-Click Digital Ocean Droplet for Teleport](./digitalocean.mdx)

## Local deployments

If you would like to set up Teleport without setting up any infrastructure
outside your local machine, but would still like a "real" deployment that you
can play with, check out or local deployment labs:

- [Docker Compose Lab](./docker-compose.mdx)
- [Local Kubernetes Lab](./local-kubernetes.mdx)
