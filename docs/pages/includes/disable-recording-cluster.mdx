## Disabling session recording

Session recording is enabled by default, and can be disabled in one of two ways:

### Disable session recording at the cluster level

To disable session recording at the cluster level, edit your `teleport.yaml`
configuration file.

```yaml
teleport:
  auth_service:
    session_recording: off
```

<Admonition type="warning">
Disabling session recording at the cluster level applies to all types of
recordings. For example, this configuration would prevent Teleport from
recording SSH, Kubernetes and desktop sessions.
</Admonition>

The `session_recording` property can also be configured dynamically by using
`tctl` to edit the cluster's `session_recording_config` resource. This is the
required approach for Teleport Cloud users.
