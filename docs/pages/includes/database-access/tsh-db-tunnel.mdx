Starting the local database proxy with the `--tunnel` flag will create an
authenticated tunnel that you can use to connect to your database instances.
You won't need to configure any credentials when connecting to this tunnel.

Here is an example on how to start the proxy:

```bash
# Start the local proxy.
$ tsh proxy db --tunnel <database-name>
Started authenticated tunnel for the <engine> database "<database-name>" in cluster "<cluster-name>" on 127.0.0.1:62652.
```

You can optionally specify the database name and the user to use by default
when connecting to the database:

```code
$ tsh proxy db --db-user=my-database-user --db-name=my-schema --tunnel <database-name>
```

Now, you can connect to the address the proxy command returns. In our example it
is `127.0.0.1:62652`.
