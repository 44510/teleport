  The Teleport Database service can connect to public or private addresses.
  To use a private address the Teleport Database service must be able to connect
  being in the same Zone and Region or other means. See [Google Cloud documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/sql-server/mysql-remote-access) on
  deploying a server that has access to a database private address.
