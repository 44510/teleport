# RFD 163 - Teleport VNet

## What

Teleport VNet creates a virtual subnet with DNS that automatically proxies TCP
connections to Teleport apps over fully authenticated virtual tunnels.

## Why

Today Teleport users have to manually create tunnels to access private services
and apps.
This creates manual overhead and does not work in many use-cases, for example,
when API endpoints are hardcoded.
Teleport VNet removes the need of manual management of tunnels for accessing
services by creating a virtual subnet and DNS that manage connections
automatically.
