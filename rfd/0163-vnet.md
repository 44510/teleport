# RFD 163 - Teleport VNet

## What

Teleport VNet creates a virtual IP subnet with DNS that automatically proxies
TCP connections to Teleport apps over fully authenticated tunnels.
After logging in once, users will be able to connect to all of their Teleport
applications at a URL or IP address with zero extra steps.
Scripts and software applications will be able to connect to Teleport-protected
applications as if they were running on the local network without any extra
configuration or even having to know that Teleport is involved.

## Why

Teleport App Access has a pretty good UX for HTTP apps accessed through a web
browser, but the experience isn't up to par outside of the browser.

Today, Teleport users have two choices for accessing Teleport-protected apps and
APIs with non-browser clients:

1. Use a custom TLS certificate and private key with the client and connect to a
   subdomain of the Teleport proxy, e.g. `curl --cert /Users/nic/.tsh/keys/one.teletest.private/nic-app/one.teletest.private/dumper-x509.pem --key /Users/nic/.tsh/keys/one.teletest.private/nic`.
2. Proxy the app to a TCP listener on localhost, e.g. `tsh proxy app dumper --port 8888 & curl 127.0.0.1:8888`

Both of these methods are fairly cumbersome, inflexible, and they may not even
be possible with some clients, especially when needing to connect to many apps
or using custom scripts or software that expects to be able to find these apps
at a regular-old DNS address.
Teleport VNet removes the need for manual management of client certs or tunnels.

## Details

Teleport VNet will run in the background on end-user devices (laptops, workstations).
It will be integrated into Teleport Connect, and may also be available as a
`tsh` command (TBD).

It works by creating a TUN virtual network interface and configuring an IP route
to send all outgoing IP packets in the VNet range through that interface.
In the background, Teleport VNET will handle all incoming TCP connections to the
TUN interface and proxy them to Teleport apps over authenticated tunnels, in
much the same way that the `tsh proxy app` command works today.

The VNET will also host a local DNS service serving custom domain names for all
Teleport-protected apps, and directing the DNS queries for each app to an IP
address in the VNet's virtual IP range assigned to the app in question.

### Domain name assignment

The default VNet domain name for each app will be `<app>.<proxy-public-address>.internal`.
For an app named `api` in a Teleport cluster at `teleport.example.com` this
would look like `api.teleport.example.com.internal`.
Each app will always be accessible at this address.

To add an alternative address, a new `spec.vnet_addr` field will be added on app
resources.
For example, the following app in cluster `teleport.example.com` could be
accessed at both `api.example.com` and `api.teleport.example.com.internal`.

```
kind: app
version: v3
metadata:
  name: api
spec:
  uri: http://localhost:12345
  vnet_addr: api.example.com
```

Because we will use split DNS to configure VNet as a DNS server, if the
`vnet_addr` is NOT suffixed with `<proxy-public-address>.internal` the Teleport
admin will need to statically configure a custom DNS zone in the cluster, see
[custom DNS zones](#custom-dns-zones).

#### Leaf and parallel clusters

A user may be logged in to multiple Teleport Clusters at once, those may be leaf
clusters or completely separate clusters.
Each cluster may include apps with identical names, so including the full proxy
address avoids assigning domain names that will conflict under these conditions.

If the user is accessing an app in a leaf Teleport cluster via a root cluster
they have logged in to, the VNet domain name will use the address of the leaf
proxy.
For an app named `api` in a Teleport cluster at `leaf.example.com` this would
look like `api.leaf.example.com.internal`
This differs conceptually from non-VNet app access where both would use the same
domain name `api.teleport.example.com` because in VNet we cannot use a client
certificate or a cookie to differentiate whether the app is in the root or a
leaf cluster.

In the corner case where a user is logged in to the same cluster both as a leaf
and a root, VNet will prefer to proxy to apps in that cluster as a root.

#### Why `.internal`

Today, by default, apps are publicly reachable at `<app>.<proxy-domain-name>`,
e.g. `api.teleport.example.com`.
That is the URL you would go to in the browser to reach an HTTP app through
Teleport, and it is also usable for TCP app access.
The domain name is expected to resolve to the public address of the Teleport Proxy.
The app at this address is protected by TLS terminated at the Teleport Proxy,
which usually has a publicly trusted wildcard TLS certificate for
`*.teleport.example.com`.

Teleport VNet will avoid overriding or conflicting with this domain name for a
few reasons:

1. To avoid incidentally breaking the currently supported flow if something goes
   wrong with the VNet or it is just not running locally.
1. While the tunnels VNet creates in the background will be authenticated by
   mTLS, local clients will see it as an unauthenticated TCP endpoint.
   When users connect to this domain name in the browser we still want them to
   see that it is protected by TLS.
1. HTTP app domain names are sharable and they can be opened by anyone with an
   account in the same cluster, regardless if they are running VNet or not.

To break the conflict we can add a TLD/suffix to the domain name used in VNet.
ICANN has recently assigned the `.internal` TLD for internal or private use
applications so it seems like the appropriate choice.
https://itp.cdn.icann.org/en/files/root-system/identification-tld-private-use-24-01-2024-en.pdf

### Custom DNS zones

Some users may want to use custom domain names for their apps in VNet.
Maybe they currently access an app on their VPN at `api.example.com` and
they want to migrate off their VPN to Teleport without changing all their
software and scripts that currently reference that name.

To do this they can set the `spec.vnet_addr` field in the app resource to
`api.example.com`, but VNet will also need to know to configure itself as
the DNS server for `*.example.com`, and what to do with other DNS requests
matching `*.example.com` with no matching Teleport app.

To accomodate this the Teleport admin can configure a custom DNS zone
cluster-wide with a new `vnet` Teleport resource:

```yaml
version: v1
kind: vnet
metadata:
  name: vnet
spec:
  custom_dns_zones:
  - suffix: .example.com
    upstream_nameservers:
    - 1.2.3.4
    - 4.5.6.7
  - suffix: .test.com
```

In this example, whenever the user is logged in to the cluster where this `vnet`
configuration resource is present, VNet will install itself as the DNS
nameserver for `*.example.com` and `*.test.com`.
Because there are no configured upstream nameservers for `*.test.com`, the VNet
DNS server will not respond to DNS requests for any invalid teleport app.

### DNS queries and IP address assignment

This design tries to avoid making the VNet client maintain an up-to-date list of
all apps in all clusters with assigned IPs.
To that end, IPs will be dynamically assigned to apps the first time DNS is
queried for that app.

The VNet process will build a reverse mapping from each proxy public access and
custom DNS zone to the cluster they belong to.
This will be updated whenever the user logs in to a new cluster.
When any DNS query is received the process is as follows:

1. If an IP address is already assigned to the full queried name, an
   authoritative answer will be sent with that IP.
   These IP assigments will not expire, if the app no longer exists that error
   will be handled when the TCP request is made to that IP.
1. If the name matches any `<app-name>.<proxy-address>.internal` we will query
   the matching cluster to see if the app actually exists.
    1. If the app does not exist, the DNS server will respond with an
       authoritative non-answer to indicate this is not a valid name.
    1. If the app does exist, a free IP will be assigned to it and it will be
       returned in an authoritative answer.
1. If the name matches `*.<custom-dns-zone>`:
    1. VNet will determine which clusters the matching custom DNS zone is in
       from its local state.
    1. VNet will query each clusters apps to see if any have a `spec.vnet_addr`
       matching the full name.
       This will use a predicate expression to do the filtering server-side and
       avoid listing all apps.
       In the unlikely case that 2 or more clusters have identical custom DNS
       zones with identital `vnet_addr`s, one will be chosen arbitrarily.
    1. If a match is found a free IP will be assigned to that app and it will be
       returned in an authoritative DNS answer.
    1. If no match is found and the zone has no `upstream_nameservers` configured,
       no DNS reply will be sent.
    1. The full DNS query will be forwarded to one of the `upstream_nameservers`
       for the custom DNS zone, selected randomly from the list, and any
       upstream response will be returned to the client verbatim.
       We may implement caching of upstream responses, in some cases the
       downstream resolver will do its own caching, we'll experiment with this.
1. If the name did not match any `<proxy-address>.internal` or custom DNS zone,
   no response will be sent.

Here is a flow chart for the above sequence:

```mermaid

    start(DNS A record query) --> checkIP{IP Assigned?}
    checkIP -- Yes --> sendIP[Reply with IP]
    checkIP -- No --> checkProxy{Matches *.proxy-address.internal?}

```

### IP range

By default IPv4 addresses will be assigned from the carrier-grade NAT range
`100.64.0.0/10`.
There are 4 million IP addresses in this range so exhaustion won't be a concern.
Since VNet IPs will only be used locally on end user machines this range is
quite unlikely to conflict with any valid public or private IP addresses, unless
another VPN client is being used that happens to use the same range.
For example, tailscale also uses this range.
This range can be overriden with a cluster-wide configuration.

```yaml
version: v1
kind: vnet
metadata:
  name: vnet
spec:
  cidr_range: 100.64.0.0/10
```

We will support IPv6 as well.
TODO: decide how to assign IPv6 IPs.

#### IP access without DNS

If a client wishes to access a Teleport app over VNet but their client does not
accept a domain name and only an IP, there are two ways this can be handled.

The first option is the user can simply ping to domain name to cause VNet to
assign an IP to the app, and then they may use that IP.

```shell
$ ping api.teleport.example.com.internal
PING api.teleport.example.com.internal (100.64.0.4): 56 data bytes
$ curl 100.64.0.4
```

Another option would be to support static configuration of an IP that will
always be assigned to an app.
This may be desirable by some users used to accessing an app at a static IP, but
the implementation would have many corner cases and could be fragile so we would
prefer not to support this in the initial implementation.

### TCP ports

Local app proxies today each listen on a unique TCP port on `127.0.0.1`.
With VNet we will assign a unique IP address to each app with the full TCP port
range available.

The reason we need to assign an IP per app, instead of having many apps on the
same IP but different ports, is that DNS only assigns an IP to each domain name
with no port, so there would be no good way for the client to discover the port
we assigned to the app.

To keep configuration as simple as possible, and because we can, the default
behavior of VNet will be to proxy TCP connections from ANY port to the app
assigned to the IP.
This way clients can use the port they expect for the app protocol, or any port
they like, with no extra configuration or need to figure out exactly which port
to use.

The exception to this is if the configured `vnet_addr` for the app explicitly
includes a port then VNet will only handle connections on that port.
This will allow multiple Teleport apps to be configured on different ports at
the same address.
For example, the following configuration would make both ports 80 and 443
available for `app.example.com`.
VNet would assign the same IP address to both of these apps because they have
the same `vnet_addr` only differing by port.

```yaml
kind: app
metadata:
  name: https-app
spec:
  uri: tcp://127.0.0.1:443
  vnet_addr: app.example.com:443
---
kind: app
metadata:
  name: http-app
spec:
  uri: tcp://127.0.0.1:80
  vnet_addr: app.example.com:80
```

### Host configuration

Vnet will need to create a TUN interface, assign an IP to it, add a route to the
routing table, and configure VNet as a DNS nameserver.

To create the TUN interface we will import `golang.zx2c4.com/wireguard/tun`
which provides cross-platform methods for creating TUN interfaces and reading
from + writing to them.
It supports MacOS, Windows, and Linux.

The following applies to MacOS only, we will have other platform-specific
methods when we add support for Windows and Linux.

To assign an IP address to the interface, we will use `os/exec` to run the
`ifconfig` command:

```shell
ifconfig utun4 100.64.0.1 100.64.0.1 up
```

To assign an IP route to use the TUN interface, we will use `os/exec` to run the
`route` command:

```shell
route add -net 100.64.0.0/10 -interface utun4
```

To configure split DNS, we will add the VNet DNS server to files under
/etc/resolver:

```shell
$ # cluster with proxy at teleport.example.com and custom DNS zone example.com
$ ls /etc/resolver/
teleport.example.com.internal example.com
$ cat /etc/resolver/teleport.example.com.internal
nameserver 100.127.100.127
$ cat /etc/resolver/example.com
nameserver 100.127.100.127
```

All system configuration must run as a privileged user (root).
In the demo implementation we are using an Applescript wrapper to call a child
process as root. Alternatives are considered under the [Alternatives to
osascript](#alternatives-to-osascript) section.
The child admin process will still be the `tsh` binary, just called with
arguments to do the host setup.
See the UX section for more details on the admin process.

The first version of VNet will only support MacOS so this is written with that
in mind, but we can implement this in a similar way for Windows and Linux.

### Security

There are certainly security implications of effectively creating
pre-authenticated TCP listeners for every app in your Teleport cluster.
Any software running on the user's machine could freely access any app.

However, this is not much different that what we already support today with
`tsh proxy app`, anything can connect to that authenticated tunnel as well.
Not to mention that the user's private key is stored at `~/.tsh` and can be used
to access anything the user can access as well.

VNet is purely a client-side convenience the effectively automates what you can
already do by creating TCP proxies for all apps.
It is built on top of Teleport's security principals like short-lived
certificates, device trust, passwordless authentication, and MFA.

VNet does not add much extra attack surface unless the user's laptop is already
compromised.

### UX

VNet is available in both tsh and Teleport Connect. This section focuses mostly on VNet integration
in Teleport Connect, with a short subsection on VNet in tsh at the end.

There are three goals that the VNet integration attempts to achieve.

1. VNet should stay out of the way.
1. VNet should serve as a complete replacement for app gateways that shipped with Connect v15.
1. The user should be naturally guided towards enabling VNet whenever they perform an action that
   needs VNet to be running.

Before we show how the UI for VNet works, there's an important requirement we need to address.

#### Root privileges

As described in [Host configuration](#host-configuration), for VNet to work we need to create a TUN
interface and configure DNS for a particular cluster. Both actions require root privileges.

The first version of VNet uses osascript's `do shell script … with administrator privileges` to
call a tsh subcommand as root. This means that VNet doesn't work in environments where the user is a
standard macOS user and cannot elevate their privileges.

While [osascript is a CLI tool intended to be used by sysadmins and not as an
API](https://forums.developer.apple.com/forums/thread/701118?answerId=705661022#705661022), it gets
us past the problem of acquiring root privileges and lets us focus on validating VNet as a tool.
In the [Alternatives to osascript](#alternatives-to-osascript) section, we describe other approaches
which offer better UX at the cost of development time.

#### Guiding the user towards VNet

Before VNet, the user would access web and TCP apps through the unified resources view in Connect:

<img width="871" alt="Unified Resources view in Connect v15.0.0" src="assets/0163-apps-in-connect-v15.png">

Clicking "Launch" next to a web app would launch this app in the browser through the `/web/launch`
URL of the proxy service. The user could also set up a local proxy for the specific app by clicking
on the three dots menu and choosing "Set up connection". For TCP apps, clicking "Connect" would set
up a local proxy for that app.

This changes with the introduction of VNet. Here's a screenshot from Teleport Connect in cluster
`teleport-local.dev` running VNet:

<img width="871" alt="Unified Resources view in Connect with VNet turned on" src="assets/0163-apps-with-vnet.png">

* dumper is a web app without `spec.vnet_addr`. "Launch" opens the app in the browser through the
  `/web/launch` of the proxy service. The user can select "Launch through VNet" from the three dots
  menu to open `http://dumper.teleport-local` or "Copy VNet address" to copy that address. The
  address in the card is `https://dumper.teleport-local.dev` as usual.
* httpbin is a web app with `spec.vnet_addr` set to `httpbin.company.private` and `.company.private`
  is configured as the suffix of a DNS zone in the `vnet` resource. "Launch" starts VNet if it's not
  already running and opens the VNet address of the app. The user can select "Launch through Web UI"
  from the three dots menu. The address in the card is `http://httpbin.company.private`.
* tcp-postgres is a TCP app without `spec.vnet_addr`. If VNet is not running, the button says
  "Connect" and it starts VNet, copies the VNet address of the app to the clipboard and shows a
  notification in the bottom right saying "Copied `tcp-postgres.teleport-local.dev.internal` to the
  clipboard.". If VNet is running, the button simply says "Copy". The user can select "Set up a
  legacy connection" which starts the equivalent of `tsh proxy app tcp-postgres` that's available
  today.

Setting up legacy connections is kept for users who might not be able to use VNet, either because
they lack root privileges or VNet would conflict with other software running on the computer.

In case of web apps, we don't know if they're intended to be used through VNet or not. The only hint
we can get is the existence of `spec.vnet_addr` which indicates that the given web app is, for
example, an HTTP API that users might want to connect to through VNet.

Selecting an app from the search bar performs the same action as clicking on the button next to an
app.

#### Managing VNet

<img width="871" alt="VNet in Connections" src="assets/0163-vnet-in-connections.png">

VNet has a persistent place in the UI in the connection list in top left. From there, the user can
see VNet status for the current root cluster and quickly stop VNet for all root clusters, similar to
how they can disconnect existing database, SSH and Kube connections.

Clicking on the VNet item opens a dedicated VNet tab. Data in this tab is scoped to the root cluster
of the current workspace. The user can see the status of VNet for the root cluster, along with an
error message if there was a problem with setting up VNet. The tab displays the DNS zones that are
currently being proxied and recent connections.

A green indicator means that a tunnel is currently open. The absence of an indicator means the
tunnel was opened but has since been closed due to inactivity. An error indicator means that a
connection for the given app could not be established. Clicking on the row with the error shows the
full error message.

<img width="871" alt="VNet tab" src="assets/0163-vnet-tab.png">

#### Lifecycle

The first version of VNet integration in Connect behaves similarly to Connect My Computer. After the
user starts VNet and until they explicitly stop it, VNet starts automatically when launching the
app. It prompts for a password for root privileges through osascript on each start.

If VNet is running and the user logs in to another cluster, Connect prompts for credentials again
and configures VNet for that cluster. If this attempt fails, VNet continues to work but the
indicator on the connection list icon shows a red exclamation mark. Upon opening the VNet tab from
the connection list, the user can learn what the error was and either retry the attempt or ignore
the error.

Unfortunately, [Touch ID prompts are reserved for Apple
clients](https://forums.developer.apple.com/forums/thread/701118?answerId=705661022#705661022). We
assume that typically the user is going to start VNet and then just leave it running, somewhat
negating the downside of having to enter credentials on each start.

##### Manual start and stop

Starting VNet by clicking the item in the connection list in the top left starts VNet for all root
clusters and turns on autostart for all of them. Stopping VNet from the connection list stops it for
all root clusters and turns off autostart for all of them.

If VNet is not running, starting VNet from the VNet tab starts it only for the root cluster of the
current workspace. Likewise, stopping it from the VNet tab stops it only for the current root
cluster and turns off autostart just for this cluster.

This behavior aligns with a couple of ideas:

1) The connection list is a UI element that is not scoped to any workspace, unlike tabs which are
always scoped to a specific workspace.
2) The user can turn off VNet for a specific workspace if they do not wish to use it in that
workspace.

##### Expired certs

As shown in the diagram in the [DNS queries and IP address
assignment](#dns-queries-and-ip-address-assignment) section, there are two calls made to the
cluster, one to get the details of an app and one to proxy a connection to the cluster. If any of
those calls fails due to expired certs, Connect prompts the user to log in again. It's similar to
how Connect prompts for relogin after the cert of a local db proxy expires.

##### Considered alternatives

###### Launch VNet on system start

Doing so would require some kind of persistent UI that is also launched on system start, perhaps an
app in the Menu Bar. The UI would need to enable the user to manage the state of VNet and provide a
way to refresh expired certs. Perhaps Connect could support headless mode where it does not open the
main window automatically and instead launches a separate frontend app which handles relogin. Alas,
we don't have a Menu Bar app now and Connect is not prepared to launch in headless mode at the
moment.

###### Ask for root privileges just once

Any of the alternatives described in the [Alternatives to osascript](#alternatives-to-osascript)
section would allow us to ask for root privileges just once at the cost of development time.

#### tsh integration

`tsh vnet` prompts for a password and sets up VNet for the current profile. The `--all` (`-R`) flag
can be used to set up VNet for all non-expired profiles. Only one instance of VNet can be active
at a time, guarded by a lockfile in the tsh directory. To allow multiple VNet instances running at
the same time, tsh processes would need to coordinate which TUN device to use and how to set up DNS.

The initial output includes a list of proxied DNS zones. The format of the list depends on the
number of profiles VNet has been configured for and the number of leaf clusters.

<details>
<summary>Different tsh vnet output formats</summary>

One cluster with no leaf clusters:

```
$ tsh vnet

Proxying connections made to .teleport-local.dev.internal, .company.private.
```

One cluster with leafs:

```
$ tsh vnet

Proxying connections made to the DNS zones listed below.

DNS Zone                         Cluster
-------------------------------- ----------------------
.teleport.example.com.internal   teleport.example.com
.example.com                     teleport.example.com
.leaf.example.com.internal       leaf.example.com
.leaf-platform.com               leaf.example.com
.other-leaf.example.com.internal other-leaf.example.com
```

Multiple root clusters. In this scenario we have to remember that the user may have access to
`leaf.example.com` both as a leaf cluster and a root cluster. We need to avoid listing it twice. The
DNS zones will be the same in both cases.

```
$ tsh vnet

Proxying connections made to the DNS zones listed below.

DNS Zone                         Cluster
-------------------------------- ----------------------
.teleport.example.com.internal   teleport.example.com
.example.com                     teleport.example.com
.leaf.example.com.internal       leaf.example.com
.leaf-platform.com               leaf.example.com
.other-leaf.example.com.internal other-leaf.example.com
.foo.teleport.sh.internal        foo.teleport.sh
.infra.acme.com                  foo.teleport.sh
```

</details>

New connection are logged to stdout, similar to the list of VNet connections in Connect. If a cert
expires, `tsh vnet` prompts for the password within the same shell session, similar to how `tsh
proxy db` does it.

```
✓ api.teleport.example.com.internal
✗ old-api.example.com: DNS query for "old-api.example.com" in custom DNS zone failed: no matching
Teleport app and upstream nameserver did not respond

Enter password for Teleport user alice:

```

#### Alternatives to osascript

##### SMAppService

[`SMAppService`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/servicemanagement/smappservice)
allows an unprivileged app to register a privileged launch daemon in launchd. That daemon is
launched on demand, does its work and then shuts down, without prompting for credentials each time.
The daemon lives in the app bundle and is automatically cleaned up when the user removes the app
bundle. Registering the daemon does not require an installer and can also be done on demand.

The main benefits of `SMAppService` are:

* A single prompt for credentials during the registration of the daemon.
* It should work for standard users, as long as an admin registers the relevant .plist from the app
  bundle in launchd.

The biggest downside is that calling both `SMAppService` and then the registered daemon most likely
requires some kind of a Swift wrapper we'd have to compile for this purpose. The other unresolved
issue is establishing secure communication with the daemon. [Launch
constraints](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/applying_launch_environment_and_library_constraints)
can restrict which apps can spawn the daemon. In Swift and Objective-C, [an XPC service can restrict
its peers through a code-signing
requirement](https://theevilbit.github.io/posts/launch_constraints_deep_dive/#global-xpc-daemon-attacks).
Further research is needed to determine if we can effectively use Go and gRPC as alternatives.

`SMAppService` requires macOS 13+, launch constraints require macOS 13.3+.

##### Network Extension

Ideally, we wouldn't even need to run a process with root privileges in the first place. This is
where Apple's [Network Extension](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/networkextension) comes
into play, specifically [Packet tunnel
provider](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/networkextension/packet_tunnel_provider). It
appears that its API provides some way of operating a TUN interface.

However, [there's little documentation about Packet tunnel provider
itself](https://forums.developer.apple.com/forums/thread/708310). What's more, shipping an app with
a Network Extension means that [both the app and the Network Extension need to run in the
sandbox](https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/132406?answerId=417988022#417988022). [Migrating
an Electron app to an App
Sandbox](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/mac-app-store-submission-guide#enable-apples-app-sandbox)
is a sizeable undertaking on its own, having to account not just for VNet, but also for things like
[running tsh from within Teleport
Connect](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/embedding-a-helper-tool-in-a-sandboxed-app).

### Proto Specification

TODO

### Backward Compatibility

We will not be changing or interfering with existing app access to backward
compatibility is not an issue.

### Audit Events

This is purely a client-side UX improvement so no audit events will be added.

### Observability

TODO

### Product Usage

TODO

### Test Plan

Manual testing of VNet with multiple clusters and custom DNS zones will be added
to the test plan.
